# To-Do-App

## Project Description

This project is a web-based to‐do list application created in reactJS to practise using forms and the map function. It provides a simple interface where a user can add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them.

### Objective

To build a to do app in react. That allows a user to manage a list of to-do items in the browser. This project aims to improve understanding of react.

- Tasks can be removed when no longer required.

### Technologies and Tools Used

- Tools: Git & GitHub for version control and hosting; VS Code to program it

## Challenges Faced

- Learning how move state to parent components from child.
- Setting up github pages proved to be difficult this time around due to build script not working as intended

## Outcome

I created a fully functional to do list app with react which allowed me to improve my skills in state management, forms, and mapping arrarys.
